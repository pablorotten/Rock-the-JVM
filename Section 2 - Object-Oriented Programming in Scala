# Rock the JVM: Scala for beginners

## Section 2: Object-Oriented Programming in Scala
### 10. Object-Oriented Basics
Create a class with a constructor.
* The parameters can be fields if have **val/var**
* Internally, we can still use the constructor parameters (use **this.parameter** if necessary)
* Can create a block {} that will be evaluated in every instantiation
* Can create methods and override them
* Can also override the constructor but it can only be another constructor, other code is not allowed

```scala
class Person(name: String, val age: Int = 0) {
  val valField = 2 // field
  var varField = "new varField"
  val first_name = name

  def greet(name: String): Unit = println(s"${this.name} says: Hi, $name") // this.name is not a class field but is still avail able with the class definition

  def this(name: String) = this(name, 0) // calls main constructor
  def this() = this("John Doe") // call previous secondary constructor
}
```
